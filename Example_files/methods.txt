These accuracy assessment points were collected via helicopter and recorded on paper datasheets. Back at the office they were entered into a Microsoft Access database. A secondary comparison of the database to the original data sheets was done to confirm there had been no transciption errors.

Details on how these data were used to assess the Everglades vegetation map can be found in the final report: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2286460
