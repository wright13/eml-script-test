Replace this text with your abstract. The abstract should describe the data within the data package and the purpose. A good rule of thumb is about 250 words in length. This abstract will be displayed on the data package landing page within DataStore and will be sent to data.gov, among other places so it is worth spending a few minutes on it. If you are careful, you may be able to re-use this abstract in the DRR describing the data package. It's a good idea to generate your abstract in a text editor (or at least look at it in one). Word processing programs such as MS Word have a habit of inserting invisible formatting characters that can make the abstract look funny. What follows is an example abstract: The thematic accuracy of the EVER vegetation map was assessed using randomly selected accuracy assessment (AA) points/grid cells across all four mapping regions. These AA points were collected between 2010 and 2013 to be as close as possible to the 2009 flight dates of the imagery used in mapping - specifically to reduce the impacts of natural community succession or perturbation events, like fires and windstorms. These data were collected from helicopter by a trained botanist who could identify South Florida plants and plant communities. The overall vegetation code was derived from the species level percent cover information as well as plot level information on tree, shrub, and herb cover and canopy height. These points were not available to the vegetation project manager, lead photo-interpreter, and the photo-interpreters working on the project until after the map was finished and the final map accuracy had been computed.
