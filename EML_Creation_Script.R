## Script Overview -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Title: NPS EML Creation Script
#
# Summary: This code creates an EML file for a data package by leveraging several functions within the EMLassemblyline
# package. In this case the example inputs are for a EVER Veg Map AA dataset and are meant to either be run as a test
# of the process or to be replaced with your own content. This is a step by step process where each section (indicated
# by dashed lines) should be reviewed, edited if necessary, and run one at a tune. After completing a section there is
# often something to do external to R (e.g. open a text file and add content). Several EMLassembly line functions are decision points and may only apply to certain data packages. The final section has the make_eml() function to put
# together a validated EML metadata file. Future updates to this script will help bring in additional functions from the
# EMLeditor package (part of the NPSdataverse) that are used to populate NPS DataStore specific tags.

## Install and Load R Packages -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Install packages - uncomment the next three lines if you've never installed EMLassemblyline before
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Load packages
library(EMLassemblyline)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)

## Set Overall Package Details -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# All of the following items should be reviewed and updated to fit the package at hand. For vectors with more than one
#item, keep the order the same (i.e. item #1 should correspond to the same file in each vector)

# Metadata filename - becomes the filename, so make sure it ends in _metadata to comply with data package specifications
metadata_id <- "TEST_EVER_AA_metadata"

# Overall package title
package_title <- "TEST_Everglades National Park Accuracy Assessment (AA) Data Package"

# Description of data collection status - choose from 'ongoing' or 'complete'
data_type <- "complete"
  
# Path to data file(s)
working_folder <- paste0(str_trim(getwd()),"/","Example_files")
  
# Vector of dataset filenames 
data_files <- c("qry_Export_AA_Points.csv",

# Vector of dataset names (brief name for each file)
data_names <- c("TEST_AA Point Data",
                "TEST_AA Vegetation Data")
  
# Vector of dataset descriptions (about 10 words describing each file). Descriptions will be used in auto-generated
# tables within the ReadMe and DRR. If you need to use more than about 10 words, consider putting that information in
# the abstract, methods, or additional info sections.
data_descriptions <- c("TEST_Everglades Vegetation Map Accuracy Assessment point data",
                       "TEST_Everglades Vegetation Map Accuracy Assessment vegetation data")

#Tell EMLassemblyline where your files will ultimately be located. Create a vector of dataset URLs - for DataStore. I recommend setting this to the main reference page. All data files from a single data package can be accessed from the same page so the URLs are the same.

# Table and field that contains scientific names that can be used to fill the taxonomic coverage metadata.
# Comment these out and do not run OPTIONAL 5 (below) if your data package does not contain species information.

# Start date and end date. This should indicate the first and last data point in the data package (across all files) and
# does not include any planning, pre- or post-processing time. The format should be one that complies with the
# International Standards Organization's standard 8601. The recommended format for EML is: YYYY-MM-DD, where Y is the
# four digit year, M is the two digit month code (01 - 12 for example, January = 01), and D is the two digit day of the
# month (01 - 31).

## EMLassemblyline Functions -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The next set of functions are meant to be considered one by one and only run if applicable to a particular
# data package. The first year will typically see all of these run, but if the data format and protocol stay constant
# over time it may be possible to skip some in future years. Additionally some datasets may not have geographic or
# taxonomic component.

# FUNCTION 1 - Core Metadata Information
# Creates blank TXT template files for the abstract, additional information, custom units, intellectual
# rights, keywords, methods, and personnel. Be sure the edit the personnel text file in Excel as it has columns.
# Typically these files can be reused between years. Currently this inserts a Creative Common 0 license.
# NOTE that if these files already exist from a previous run, they are not overwritten.
template_core_metadata(path = working_folder, 
                       license = "CC0")

# FUNCTION 2 - Data Table Attributes
# Creates an "attributes_datafilename.txt" file for each data file. This can be opened in Excel
# (we recommend against trying to update these in a text editor) and fill in/adjust the columns for attributeDefinition,
# class, unit, etc. refer to https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/articles/edit_tmplts.html for helpful hints and
# view_unit_dictionary() for potential units. This will only need to be run again if the attributes (name, order or
# new/deleted fields) are modified from the previous year.
# NOTE that if these files already exist from a previous run, they are not overwritten.
template_table_attributes(path = working_folder, 
                          data.table = data_files, 
                          write.file = TRUE)

# FUNCTION 3 - Data Table Categorical Variable
# Creates a "catvars_datafilename.txt" file for each data file that has columns with a class = categorical.
# These txt files will include each unique 'code' and allow input of the corresponding 'definition'.NOTE that since the
# list of codes is harvested from the data itself, it's possible that additional codes may have been relevant/possible
# but they are not automatically included here. Consider your lookup lists carefully to see if additional options should
# be included (e.g if your dataset DPL values are all set to "Accepted" this function will not include "Raw" or
# "Provisional" in the resulting file and you may want to add those manually).
# NOTE that if these files already exist from a previous run, they are not overwritten.
template_categorical_variables(path = working_folder, 
                               data.path = working_folder, 
                               write.file = TRUE)

# FUNCTION 4 - Geographic Coverage
# Creates a geographic_coverage.txt file that lists your sites as points as long as your coordinates are
# in lat/long. If your coordinates are in UTM it is probably easiest to convert them first or create the
# geographic_coverage.txt file another way (see https://github.com/nationalparkservice/QCkit for R functions that will
# convert UTM to lat/long).
template_geographic_coverage(path = working_folder, 
                             data.path = working_folder,

                             write.file = TRUE)

# FUNCTION 5 - Taxonomic Coverage
# Creates a taxonomic_coverage.txt file if you have taxonomic data. Currently supported authorities are
# 3 = ITIS, 9 = WORMS, and 11 = GBIF.
template_taxonomic_coverage(path = working_folder, 
                            data.path = working_folder,

                            write.file = TRUE)

## Create an EML File ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Run this (it may take a little while) and see if it validates (you should see 'Validation passed'). Additionally there
# could be some issues to review as well. Run the function 'issues()' at the end of the process to get feedback on items
# that might be missing or need attention.
make_eml(path = working_folder,
         dataset.title = package_title,
         data.table = data_files,

         temporal.coverage = c(startdate, enddate),
         maintenance.description = data_type,

## EMLeditor Functions (COMING SOON!) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Now that you have valid EML metadata, you need to add NPS-specific elements and fields. For instance, unit connections, DOIs, referencing a DRR, etc. To do that, use the R/EMLeditor package at https://github.com/nationalparkservice/EML_editor.

#Some functions from EMLeditor that will be critical to run include:

#set.CUI, set.DOI, set.DRRdoi and set.parkUnits (with more to come soon).
